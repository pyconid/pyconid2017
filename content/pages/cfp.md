Title: Call For Papers
Date: 2017-12-12 14:20

**CFP CLOSED!**

PyCon Indonesia is pleased to announce that the Call For Proposals is now open. We are calling out for speakers to share their Python knowledge which would intrigue the Python community at this event!

We’re looking for proposals on every aspect of Python: from basic to advanced levels. We’re interested to see all content that’s interesting and engaging to the Python community, whether it be tutorials, case studies, interactive sessions, or even how you and your organization works with Python. So if you have something that the community might be interested in, let us know; and don’t worry if you’re a seasoned engineer or a novice with no experience of presenting at a conference before; what matters is the content that you’ll be sharing with the community.

Talks can be as short as 15 minutes and go up to 30 minutes, and Workshops can be up to 60 minutes long. So whether you’re a Python veteran, or a blooming beginner, we welcome you to join the event and share your knowledge with the community. Start by submitting your proposal now.

## Important Dates

*   Call For Proposals begin: Friday, 16 October 2017
*   Proposal submission deadline: Monday, 06 November 2017

## Proposal Types

Talks are limited to a maximum of 30 minutes, and may preferably be accompanied with helping material (presentation, document, etc). Talks could be on a variety of topics (for further details and inspiration, check out the next section).

Workshops, tutorials, and interactive sessions have a 90 minutes limit. For workshops, we encourage tutorials that can be helpful to the community at any level, whether beginner or advanced. Both time slots include time for questions from the audience, so please plan your talk accordingly.

### Suggested Topics

The following is a list of topics we'd like to cover in the conference.

*   History and Evolution of Python
*   Language & Features: e.g. meta classes, what's new in v3.6
*   Libraries & Frameworks: e.g. Intro to Flask, ORM in Django, Creating a Web App in Django
*   Testing & Debugging: e.g. effective testing techniques, intro to load testing
*   Python vs. Other Languages: e.g. CodeIgniter vs. Django, .NET vs. Django
*   Python Paradigms: e.g. functional programming, multithreading, parallelism
*   Applied Python: e.g. python & big data, machine learning, embedded systems
*   Tutorials: e.g. get started with machine learning, data extraction, spam detection

Presentation subjects may range from reports on open source, academic or commercial projects; or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation is interesting and useful to the Python community, it will be considered for inclusion in the program. We're especially interested in short presentations that will teach conference-goers something new and useful.
